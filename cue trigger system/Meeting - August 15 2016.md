#Motivation
- Tools for artists such as Max/MSP are hard to sequence cues beyond basic (eg. non linear control);
- Go beyond basic timeline & interactiveness: Incorporate notion of agent as an approach to control;
- Challenges from a HCI perspective: (a) "Low ‘‘Entry Fee’’ with No Ceiling on Virtuosity"; (b) creativity support tool, user-centered;

#Goal
- To control/sequence the states/timeline(timing?)/behavior tree;
- Support basic media (video/audio)?
- Cue triggering in other platforms? Controlling States!

#Users
- Performers (Vjs, musicians, visual artists)?
- Artists/conductor willing a centered tool to control their multimedia pieces?
- Students learning creative tech tools (e.g. MAX, Pd, OF, Processing);

#Design guidelines
- Easy-to-use, intuitive;
- Based on user-centered design;
- Playful;
- Incremental finer-grain controls as the user's expertise advances (e.g. if users are really experts, they can start coding their own functionalities);
- Modular, extendable via plugins;
- Support standard protocols in new media practice (i.e. MIDI, OSC, DMX, Arduino) as input and output;
- Open-source & Cross-platform (Mac & Linux & Windows, in laptops);
- realtime, for live performances, but latency is not critical;
