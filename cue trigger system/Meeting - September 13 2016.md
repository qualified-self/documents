Harry shared his previous experiences in audiovisual performance:

- Audience would need a clear sequence;

- States to organize things conceptually;

- States define behavior over time;

- Importance of teamwork in his practice. There was a conversation (intense OSC exchange) between performers. Sometimes, they wanted to see, for example, how the sound was coded so that they would ask for specific parameters to be sent over OSC;

- How do we deal with transitions between states?
