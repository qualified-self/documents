#General research question
How can we create a cue triggering system that, if compared to alternatives, would be easy-to-use, and at the same time would afford expertise and virtuosity (i.e. i.e. "low entry fee with no ceiling on virtuosity" {Wessel2002} or "low threshold, high ceilings, and wide walls" {Schneiderman2009})?

##Specific questions
- What do users think about the alternatives in terms of **ease-of-use** and ***potential for expressiveness***;
- What makes these tools **easy** or **complicated** to use?

##Alternatives
The QLab, and the VÃ©zier. It would be nice to test a behavior tree tool (i.e. Unity's RAIN), but this would required different tasks.

##Tasks
Ideally, these tasks would be easy, quick, and representative (concerning our design guidelines). The three following are just suggestions:
1. Cue 1 - Trigger an audio in the beginning of the piece;
2. Cue 2 - Trigger a MIDI note (60) and a sound sample at _the same time_ a few minutes after Cue 1;
3. Cue 3 - Create any OSC cue based on a user input condition (e.g. if mic input level bigger than a certain value, send a OSC message).

##Method & Procedure

**Informal pre-interview:** In the beginning, participants will be shortly interviewed about: a) Their background (are they our target users?); b) Previous experiences with digital tools (MAX? Processing? OF? Pd?); and c) Any experience with cue triggering systems? How do they do it today? Any experience with behavior trees?;

**Think Aloud protocol:** Participants will be asked to accomplish the tasks using the different tools at time. A 30 minutes limit will be set for each tool. During the interaction, participants will be asked to verbalize whatever they are thinking in the moment of the interaction (e.g. now I'm trying this button because of this, this and this. I feel like this, and this..). The interaction will be videotaped for future analysis.

**Informal post-interview:** At the end, participants will be shortly interviewed about their experiences. In particular, we want to know:
	- If you were to rank these tools according to _ease-of-use_, what this rank would be? Why?
	- If you were to rank these tools according to potential for _expressiveness_, what this rank would be? Why?
